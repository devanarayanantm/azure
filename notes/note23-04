 DEVOPS:
‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉDevOps is a combination of 
‚Ä¢	tools, 
‚Ä¢	practices, and 
‚Ä¢	cultural philosophy 
that helps in delivering high-quality software faster and more reliably through automation and collaboration.
 
Gate Management in DevOps:
‚Ä¢	Acts as a control checkpoint
‚Ä¢	Used to decide when to allow a process or deployment to move forward
‚Ä¢	Helps in improving quality by catching issues early and reducing technical debt
 
DevOps is a combination of 3 things:
Tools
Used for automation, integration, and tracking:
‚Ä¢	Ansible ‚Äì Configuration management
‚Ä¢	Jenkins ‚Äì CI/CD automation
‚Ä¢	Jira ‚Äì Project and issue tracking

Practices 
Key DevOps lifecycle stages:
Plan ‚Üí Code ‚Üí Build ‚Üí Test ‚Üí Release ‚Üí Deploy ‚Üí Operate ‚Üí Monitor 
Other Important Practices:
‚Ä¢	CI/CD ‚Äì Continuous Integration & Delivery
‚Ä¢	IaC (Infrastructure as Code) ‚Äì Automate infrastructure setup (e.g., using Terraform, ARM templates)
‚Ä¢	Certificate Management ‚Äì Secure communication
‚Ä¢	Security Checks ‚Äì Integration of tools to catch vulnerabilities early
 
________________________________________
 
Cultural Philosophy
‚Ä¢	Collaboration between Development, Operations, QA, and Security
‚Ä¢	Encourages shared responsibility, faster feedback, and continuous improvement
 
 
DevSecOps:
‚Ä¢	DevSecOps = Development + Security + Operations
‚Ä¢	It integrates security into every step of the DevOps pipeline
‚Ä¢	SAST ‚Äì Static Application Security Testing
o	Scans source code for vulnerabilities
o	Should be done during the integration phase (not after deployment)
o	Helps catch security issues early in the build process





 
IAAS VS SAAS VS PAAS
       

1.	IaaS:  Cloud model where you rent complete infrastructure (like virtual machines, storage, networks) from a provider (e.g., Azure), and you manage everything on top of it.
‚Ä¢	eg:Working from home with no laptop and no salary = You have no infrastructure to work.
‚Ä¢	If UST provides you a laptop, network, and setup, now you have complete infra = That‚Äôs IaaS.
‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉAdvantages of IaaS:
 
 
‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉ 
Self service provisioning:
‚Ä¢	create almost any kind of services (instance,cluster,acr,roles,acs,azure files,storages,devops pipeline,network,subnet)      
‚Ä¢	 portal - self-explanatory (dont need trainer)         
‚Ä¢	dis: time,consistency

Beneits of IaaS
‚Ä¢	üí∏ Cost Reduction
No need to invest in physical infrastructure. Pay-as-you-go model helps cut upfront costs.
‚Ä¢	‚ö° Faster Deployment (Automated)
Automation tools enable faster provisioning, testing, and releasing ‚Äî reduces time-to-market.
‚Ä¢	üîÅ High Availability & Reliability
Use of AMIs (Amazon Machine Images) ensures reliable replication and fast recovery in case of failures.
‚Ä¢	üåç Global Reach
Easily deploy applications in any region around the world to serve users with low latency.
‚Ä¢	üîê Data Security and Compliance
Data can be encrypted and moved to specific regions to comply with local regulations and standards.

Challenges of Iaas
‚Ä¢	 Security & Vulnerabilities
Cloud platforms may face vulnerabilities ‚Äî providers send alerts, but you must apply patches yourself (especially in IaaS).
‚Ä¢	 Compliance Requirements
Industries like banking and healthcare (e.g., HIPAA in the US) require strict data confidentiality.
‚Ä¢	In SaaS, data is with the provider.
‚Ä¢	In IaaS, you are responsible for compliance and data protection.
‚Ä¢	Integration with Existing Systems
Old systems (legacy apps) may not work smoothly with new cloud or automation tools ‚Äî so extra effort or changes may be needed to make them work together.
‚Ä¢	Dependency on Cloud Provider
Service interruptions, pricing changes, or policy shifts by the provider can impact your business.
